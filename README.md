# Building Robust RESTful APIs with Spring

Welcome to my journey of crafting robust and adaptable REST APIs using the power of the Spring framework

## Key Lessons I've Learned

1. **Supporting Legacy Fields:**
   Instead of outright removing old fields from my API responses, I've learned the significance of supporting them. This thoughtful approach ensures that existing clients, even those beyond my control, can continue functioning seamlessly without encountering missing data.

2. **Embracing Rel-Based Links:**
   I realized the importance of dynamic and flexible navigation for clients. By embracing rel-based links, I've empowered clients to navigate resources without relying on fixed URIs that might change over time.

3. **Retaining Familiar Links:**
   Through my work, I've come to understand the value of maintaining familiarity for clients. While introducing changes to URIs, retaining the relationships (rels) that clients are accustomed to ensures a smooth transition to newer features.

4. **Effective Use of Links for State Management:**
   I've harnessed the power of links as a means of instructing clients about available state-driving operations. This strategic use of links, rather than payload data, maintains a clear and consistent communication channel between my services and clients.

5. **Empowering Controllers with RepresentationModelAssembler:**
   Despite the initial perceived effort, implementing RepresentationModelAssembler components, in combination with Spring HATEOAS, has significantly enhanced the manageability of my controllers. This proactive approach ensures that the evolution of my API remains seamless and well-structured.

## Structure of My Project

This project showcases different fundamental concepts:

- **nonrest:** Here, I've built a straightforward Spring MVC app that illustrates the basics of API development without hypermedia considerations.
- **rest:** I've taken a step further by creating a Spring MVC + Spring HATEOAS app that demonstrates how to create HAL representations of resources, thereby enhancing API discoverability.
- **evolution:** As an exercise, I've showcased how to evolve a field while ensuring backward compatibility with older data.
- **links:** Lastly, I've demonstrated the use of conditional links to signal valid state changes to clients.

## How to Get Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Explore the Employee and Order controllers and try out different API endpoints using Postman or the Browser
